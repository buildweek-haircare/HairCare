# HairCare
Lambda BuildWeek showcasing HairCare. 

Our marketing website is a solution to the problem of finding talented hair stylist for everyday people.   Whatâ€™s unique about our website is that as a user you can click on a hair stylist and see their specific posts to see if they're doing hair the way I'd like yours to be done. Also, a user you can upvote or downvote a hair stylist so that you can give your opinions as to whether or not their services are something that you like.  
As a stylist, you can create an account so that you can broadcast your work. Also, as a stylist, you have the capability to develop postings so that users can see what I've done with my skills and talents.
The creators of this project are Yarriba Castro and Jacqueline Omollo.
